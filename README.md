# PHPUnit Extended
The extension uses the next libraries to make it work:
- [DOM](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php): the new native PHP 8.4 DOM library to make assertions against XML/HTML DOM structures
- [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/): HTTP message interfaces to make assertions against HTTP server response objects
- [JSONPath](https://github.com/Galbar/JsonPath-PHP): JSONPath library for PHP to make assertions against JSON structures
